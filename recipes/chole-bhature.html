    <h1><u>Delicious <em>Homemade Chole Bhature</em></u></h1>
    <p>Paneer Lababdar" is an indulgent North Indian curry that celebrates the richness of paneer in its most decadent form. The word "Lababdar" comes from Persian roots, meaning ‘desirable’ or ‘something that melts your heart with indulgence’. True to its name, this dish offers a luxurious experience—soft cubes of paneer simmered in a velvety gravy made with tomatoes, onions, butter, cream, and an aromatic blend of spices.

What makes Paneer Lababdar unique is its dual-paneer texture: soft paneer cubes combined with a bit of grated paneer in the gravy, creating an extra creamy and slightly chunky consistency. Cashew paste adds a mild sweetness and a nutty depth, while fresh cream and butter give it a silky finish. The spices are well-balanced—mild enough to let the creamy flavors shine, yet aromatic enough to deliver that signature North Indian richness.

Paneer Lababdar is a restaurant-style favorite, often served in weddings, festive feasts, and family dinners, paired with butter naan, roti, or fragrant jeera rice. Its vibrant orange color, rich texture, and irresistible aroma make it not just a meal, but an experience that evokes the grandeur of Mughlai cuisine blended with Punjabi warmth.</p>
