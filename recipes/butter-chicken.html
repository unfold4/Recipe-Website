        <h1><u>Delicious <em>Homemade Butter Chicken</em></u></h1>
         <p>Butter Chicken, or Murgh Makhani, is one of the most beloved dishes in Indian cuisine, cherished both in its homeland and across the globe. It features succulent pieces of chicken that are first marinated in a rich mixture of yogurt and an aromatic blend of spices, allowing the flavors to deeply penetrate the meat. The chicken is then cooked to perfection and enveloped in a velvety, tomato-based gravy that is infused with butter, cream, and a delicate balance of spices. The result is a dish that is simultaneously creamy, mildly spiced, and decadently flavorful, with every bite offering a perfect harmony of textures and tastes. Traditionally enjoyed with naan, roti, or steamed rice, butter chicken is more than just a meal—it’s a comforting culinary experience that evokes warmth, celebration, and the rich culinary heritage of North India. Whether served at a family dinner, a festive gathering, or a special occasion, this dish never fails to impress and satisfy.</p>

            </ol>
